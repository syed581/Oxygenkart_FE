          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to OxygenKart. These Terms and Conditions govern your use of
            our website and services. By accessing or using our site and
            services, you agree to comply with and be bound by these terms.

          <h2>2. Trading Signals</h2>
          <p>
            Our service provides accurate Buy and Sell signals for day trading.
            However, market behavior can be unpredictable. Therefore, you
            acknowledge and agree that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Trading involves risk, and you should be aware of these risks
              before acting on our signals.
            </li>
            <li>
              OxygenKart and its employees are not responsible for any losses
              incurred due to the Buy and Sell signals provided.

          <h2>3. Trading Course</h2>
          <p>
            Our trading course is designed to enable you to start trading from
            day one. This is applicable only if you have an active Zerodha
            trading account. Additionally:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The course suggests that you can earn back the money spent on the
              course, but this is contingent upon market conditions aligning
              with our expectations and signals. If the market behaves contrary
              to our predictions, this may not be possible.

          <p>
            OxygenKart and its employees are not responsible for any losses
            incurred during trading. You acknowledge and agree that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Trading is inherently risky, and you accept full responsibility

              signals and courses.
